Make sure you have a browser installed and running on your machine.  
Browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by serving the index.html file.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- css                (stylesheets for page)
  +-- mobile.css        (specific stylesheet)
+-- js                (source code for page)
  +-- main.js              (actual logic)
+-- images                (png and svg for page)  
+-- index.html       (markup)
+-- README.md           (general info)

```
## Tech Stack
---

I prefered to go simple because it allowed me to fine tune the page the best that I can while trying to
keep the source code clean.
